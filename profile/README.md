## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

> This organization was created for the IRCITE 2024 - Hackathon Challenge primarily in the development of Attend.ly, a next-gen attendance app, and might be used for collaborations on future projects. We are a duo from Systems Plus College Foundation, as part of the ICTDU organization.
